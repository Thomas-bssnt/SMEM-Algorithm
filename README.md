## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the Machine Learning course in the Physics of Complex Systems master's program. The objective was to reimplement a machine learning algorithm from a research article, from scratch.

The algorithm implemented here is the **Split and Merge Expectation-Maximization (SMEM) Algorithm
**, which is an enhancement of the traditional EM algorithm used for estimating the parameters of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). This method is designed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of Gaussian mixture density estimates by iteratively splitting and merging components of the mixture model.
